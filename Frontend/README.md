# Foo Inc Frontend

**:warning: Please install/add all tools and configurations first from the Config & Release document**

This directory contains the frontend code for the Foo Inc. Associated Engineering project. This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

Before running the scripts from below, please run `yarn` to install all frontend dependencies.

## File Structure
All source code is in the `./src` directory

+ `./src/index.js` is the entry point for our project
+ `./src/actions` contains the action creators, we also initiate asynchronous API calls in here.
+ `./src/api` contains logic for calling our backend service
+ `./src/assets` contains assets for this project
+ `./src/components` contains the main UI components and related logic
+ `./src/mocks` contains mock backend API responses
+ `./src/reducers` contains Redux reducers
+ `./src/states` contains default and mock states


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn cypress`

Launches the Cypress app where you can run all of the E2E tests. Be sure to run `yarn start` first or else the Cypress tests will not be able to run.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn test` 
**(Currently does nothing because all of our tests are handled by `yarn cypress`)**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
